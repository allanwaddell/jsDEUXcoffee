Script for static conversion of javascript projects to coffeescript 

We kicked off a MEAN.js project recently and it bugged me that there wasnt any yo templates for coffe-script (in the whole minute I spent looking). 

See included bash script; created for the purpose of converting a folder and children to .coffee files. There is nothing Hi-Fi about this script, if it's useful to anyone then great. 

I'm considering re-writing it in node.js and coffee just for kicks, but that may stretch me beyond my interest threshold. 

The original bash file is adapted from here: https://devblog.supportbee.com//2011/07/06/converting-a-javascript-project-to-coffeescript/
